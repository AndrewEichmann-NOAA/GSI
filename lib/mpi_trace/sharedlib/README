The makelib script should take a static wrapper library and use it to
re-build the libmpi_r.a shared library.  

(1) Edit the makelib script, select the wrapper library, either 
    libmpitrace.a or libmpihpm.a, and specify the extra shared 
    libs that are needed.

(2) Run the makelib script.

To use the new libmpi_r.a library, set MP_EUILIBPATH to point to the
re-built libmpi_r.a, which should be available in this directory.

With this method it is not necessary to compile or link the executable
with wrapper libraries - all you have to do is set MP_EUILIBPATH.
