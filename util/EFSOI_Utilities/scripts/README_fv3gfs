This file, README_fv3gfs, describes the files in GSI/util/EFSOI_Utilities/scripts
under the branch EXP-efso_fv3.  These files are expected to be merged into master
shortly (as of 2020-07-30) 


getefsiofiles.sh: obtains files necessary for gdaseupd task in global workflow,
the modified version of which is the first step in the EFSOI process

copyefsoifiles.sh: copies files from experiment to EFSOI staging directory after 
gdasepos has run 

display_osense.py: reads and plots sensitivity data for single cycle after reading
from osense file generated by EFSOI executable

osense.py: contains routine to read osense file

convdata_codes.csv: codes needed to organize convetional data sources, derived from
webpage (with the help of tools in pandas): 
https://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/data_processing/prepbufr.doc/table_2.htm 
May need to be periodically updated

The following are left from Dave Groff's development work and are not longer viable, 
but are retained for historical reference to aid current development. Once the
EFSOI utility is fully running they can be removed

efso_advance_ensemble.sh
efso_cleanup.sh
efso_cleanup_wrapper.sh
efso_file_assembly.sh
efso_run.sh
efso_wrapper.sh
