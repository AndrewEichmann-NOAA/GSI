This script runs the unit test of GFS/GDAS EFSOI executable
It requires a build of global-workflow with the EFSOI infrastructure,
a build of GSI branch with EFSOI, and data files that can be downloaded
from HPSS. 

Currently this only works on Hera.

First set up the ROTDIR where you normally keep them. Run

hpsstar get /NCEPDEV/emc-global/1year/Andrew.Eichmann/EFSOI/EFSOI-test.tar

which will download the ROTDIR contents from HPSS. 


The test script is run like so:

sbatch < jobscript.sh 

There are environment variables that the user should change before running:

In jobscript.sh:
TEST_ROOT: 	the directory this README is located; this is to access the 
		config files in expdir

In expdir/config.base:
HOMEgfs: 	a functioning build of global-workflow
PSLOT & ROTDIR: location of your ROTDIR

In expdir/config.efsoi:
EFSOIEXEC:	the path to the global_efsoi.x executable to test

You also might want to change the Slurm batch environment variables such as

#SBATCH --account
and
#SBATCH --qos 


Maintenance note: the config files in expdir are largely the same as those of 
a current develop build of global-workflow, and should remain as such or the 
future equivalent. Much of the contents is superfluous to the testing, but it 
might not be clear which parts are, and it is probably easiest for them to 
resemble current usage.
