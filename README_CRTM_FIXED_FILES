NOTES on CRTM coefficients 
Last updated: Nov 25, 2013
------------------------------------------------------------------------
GSI requires the CRTM coefficients for the assimilation of satellite radiance data.

These coefficients are not included with the other fixed files due to their large size. 

These coefficients may be obtained in the following ways.

Staged on disk:

On Jet
/lfs1/projects/dtc-hurr/datasets/fix/gsi/CRTM_Coefficients-2.1.3
or
/lfs1/projects/dtc-hurr/Donald.Stark/GSI/data/fix/CRTM_Coefficients-2.1.3

On Zeus
/scratch1/portfolios/BMC/dtc-hwrf/datasets/fix/gsi/CRTM_Coefficients-2.1.3
or
/scratch1/portfolios/BMC/dtc-hwrf/Donald.Stark/GSI/data/fix/CRTM_Coefficients-2.1.3

On Yellowstone
/glade/p/ral/jnt/tools/nwprod/CRTM_Coefficients-2.1.3


And from the EMC svn repository at:

https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/crtm/tags/REL-2.1.3/fix

You will need the following directorys from the repository:

AerosolCoeff/  CloudCoeff/  EmisCoeff/  SpcCoeff/  TauCoeff/
